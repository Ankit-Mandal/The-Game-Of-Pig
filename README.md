# The-Game-Of-Pig

This is an implementation of the __Pig game__, which is a simple dice game. In this game, players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. Here, we have implemented the game such that the first player to score 100 or greater wins. 
This project utilizes JavaScript, HTML and CSS,.
